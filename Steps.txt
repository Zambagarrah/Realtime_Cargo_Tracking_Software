Initialised the prj with Yarn, Vite & React-router-dom.
Folder structure and reusable conventions.
Global styles and accessibility-friendly base.
    We’ll define simple CSS variables and global resets for a clean, readable UI. Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes will be used across components.
JWT auth context with role-based access.
    We’ll implement an AuthContext using useReducer. It will store the JWT in localStorage, parse roles from the payload (stubbed), and expose helpers to login, logout, and guard routes.
Stubbed API client and services.
    We’ll create a thin fetch wrapper that attaches the JWT when present. Services will expose async functions ready to swap to a real backend later. For now, responses are mocked.
