Initialised the prj with Yarn, Vite & React-router-dom.
Folder structure and reusable conventions.
Global styles and accessibility-friendly base.
    We’ll define simple CSS variables and global resets for a clean, readable UI. Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes will be used across components.
JWT auth context with role-based access.
    We’ll implement an AuthContext using useReducer. It will store the JWT in localStorage, parse roles from the payload (stubbed), and expose helpers to login, logout, and guard routes.
Stubbed API client and services.
    We’ll create a thin fetch wrapper that attaches the JWT when present. Services will expose async functions ready to swap to a real backend later. For now, responses are mocked.
Routing with protected routes and role-based guards.
    We’ll define route configuration and a ProtectedRoute component that checks authentication and roles. Unauthorized users are redirected to login.
Accessible UI components.
    We’ll build reusable components: Navbar with auth awareness, FormField for labeled inputs, ConsignmentCard, a basic Chart (SVG), and Google Map wrapper.
Authentication pages and dashboard.
    We’ll implement Login and Register pages with accessible forms, then a Dashboard listing consignments using our service. The dashboard gives quick visibility into shipments.
Consignment detail and creation form.
    We’ll implement viewing details (including a map marker) and creating new consignments with validation. This supports daily operations for dispatchers.
Realtime tracking (polling stub with Google Maps).
    We’ll simulate realtime updates via polling. When a real backend or WebSocket is available, you can switch the data source easily.
Admin panel with user management and analytics.
    We’ll provide CRUD for users and show simple analytics charts. Route is restricted to admins by ProtectedRoute.
Hook for guarding links (optional UX improvement).
    We’ll add a tiny hook that you can use if you want to prevent accidental navigation away from dirty forms. This is optional and shows how to keep UX thoughtful using built-in hooks.

Add a NotFound (404) Page
Add Loading and Error States.
    We’ll add a reusable Loader and ErrorMessage component.
